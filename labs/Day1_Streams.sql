/*==============================STREAMS==================

CDC - Change Data Capture

Stream: A stream object records data manipulation language (DML) changes made to tables, including inserts (including COPY INTO), updates, and deletes, as well as metadata about each change, so that actions can be taken using the changed data

Types of Stream: STANDARD, APPEND_ONLY, INSERT_ONLY

Repeatable Read Isolation:

/*=============Types of Streams======

Types of Stream: 

STANDARD: Tracks all DML transactions

APPEND_ONLY: Tracks only INSERT DML, (DELETE AND UPDATE are ignored)

INSERT_ONLY (Exclusive for external tables): Tracks only INSERT DML. Ignoring delete operations

=====================================*/



/*=============Stale Stream=============

A stream becomes stale when its offset is beyond the data retention period of its source table. 
When stale, historical data becomes inaccessible.

if unconsumed, Snowflake can extend retention up to 14 days by default to avoid staleness.

If a source table/view is recreated, any stream on it becomes stale.

Cloning a database or schema makes unconsumed records in the cloned stream inaccessible.

Renaming doesn't break or stale a stream. Dropping and recreating an object with the same name doesn't link old streams to the new
object.

if stream become stale, recreate it.

/*=========================STREAMS ON VIEW=======

Streams on Views Overview
● Streams can be applied to both local and shared views using Snowflake Secure Data Sharing.
● Not applicable for materialized views.
● Underlying tables for the views must be native tables.
● Change tracking should be enabled on the underlying tables.

Supported View Operations
● Projections
● Filters
● Inner or cross joins
● UNION ALL
● Nested views and subqueries in the FROM clause

Unsupported View Operations
● GROUP BY clauses
● QUALIFY clauses
● Subqueries not in the FROM clause
● Correlated subqueries
● LIMIT clauses
